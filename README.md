# Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains code for a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network used for predicting the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews.

This work was completed as part of an assignment for the CT5133 Module - Deep Learning, at NUI Galway.

The movie review data was obtained from:
https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

A subset of the available data was chosen, with 12,500 positive reviews, and 12,500 negative reviews.

The LSTM network was originally trained in the Jupyter notebook on Google Collab using a GPU to speed up the training process.

Upon evaluation of the LSTM network on test data, the predictive accuracy of the model was found to be 87%.
